## HelloCircuitPython

### Description

Show that i've got the metro and vsCode working.

### Evidence

[myCode](myRGBLED.py)

### Image

![sa](./Images/SwingArm.png)

### Reflection

I set up my vs code.I learned about the rgb scale.I learned about the delay of time.

## CircuitPythonServo

### Description

Im going to make a servo work in CurcuitPython

### Evidence

[code for this assignment ](myRGBLED.py)

### Image

### Reflection
To get started I had to look at other people code to reference.The first part was hard to get started.But after I got started and all came together and I got it done.

## CircuitPythonDistanceSensor

### Description
Im going to get the disatance sensor read how far the nearest object is
### Evidence

![smile](./Images/.)

### Reflection
This assigment was simple.When the distance sensor detects something it flashes red twice.I had to use code to reference what im doing to complete this assignment.

## MotorControl

### Description
You use a potentiometer to control the motor
 
### Evidence

### Reflection
I struggled with this assignment because there wasn't nothing to reference.But with teacher assistance I figured it outMy code was right but I messed up mmy wiring.

## Example Markdown
## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence
[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0d70f655203ca304cb3c5b7d/w/f55603f962f6fc74f5548a68/e/41d730c570a8d75fce9f51b6)

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
